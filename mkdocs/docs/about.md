# About

Tired of getting slammed by scanners and curious as to what they're throwing at your system? Fishler might help.

You can configure it to log every username/password combination thrown at your system.

If you're feeling adventurous you can expose a vicarious and ephemeral Docker container via. authentication to Fishler over SSH.

A container is spun up for any remote IP that connects and authenticates with success - providing a read-only filesystem that you define. Exposing whatever files you would like to 'share'.
