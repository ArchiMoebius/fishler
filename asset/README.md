# Docker

This is a special folder - while once can built the image - Golang is used at runtime, if the image is needed.

The `rootfs` folder is exactly that - the root filesystem for the docker image - the contents of which will be built into the image.

***DO NOT alter `/bash` nor `/fixme` unless you know what you're doing :-P***
